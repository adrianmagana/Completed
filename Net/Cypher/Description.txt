This is a quick desktop application that replicates some of the basic conceptions of https security. 
The application itself can send symmetric and asymmetric encrypted messages between the client and server. 
The code was designed to mimic how a server and client would create a secure connection. The secure 
connection is done by the client using a public key, provided the server, to encrypt a copy of a new key. 
The encrypted key is then sent to the server where it is decrypted so both sides are capable of encrypting and decrypting messages.
