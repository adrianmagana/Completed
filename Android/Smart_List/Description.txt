Smart List is a shopping list application that attempts to order items on your shopping list based on the order you are likely to get them. 
The predictive sorting works based on the tendency people have to follow their same path around the store especially when grocery shopping. 
The application achieves this by assigning a value to each item that goes up or down based on when the item was crossed out for that trip and 
sorting using that number. Aside from the sorting mechanism the app also has a widget and autocomplete suggestions from previously 
added or saved items.
